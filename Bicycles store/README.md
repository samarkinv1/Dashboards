This my first Power BI dashboard from educational course. In this dashboard presented a fake company called Adventure Works, which sells bicycles and accessories to them. The idea was to create a three-paged dahsboard with the following structure: first page is the mane page about overall sells and how company is going in general. Looking on the point of view from main business metrics: revenue, profit, sells in quantity and margins. The second page is about product details. And the last page is the details about the customers.
